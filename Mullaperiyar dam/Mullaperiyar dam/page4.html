              <p align="justify" class="aa">The unique idea of harnessing the  westward flowing water of the Periyar river and diverting it to the eastward  flowing Vaigai river was first explored in 1789 by Pradani Muthirulappa Pillai,  a minister of the Ramnad king Muthuramalinga Sethupathy, who gave it up as he  found it to be expensive. The location of the dam had first been scouted by  Captain J. L. Caldwell, Madras Engineers (abbreviated as M.E.) in 1808 to  reconnoitre the feasibility of providing water from the Periyar river to  Madurai by a tunnel through the mountains. Caldwell discovered that the  excavation needed would be in excess of 100 feet in depth and the project was  abandoned with the comment in his report as &quot;decidedly chimerical and  unworthy of any further regard&quot;.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="aa"><br />
                The first attempt at damming the  Periyaar with an earthen dam in 1850 was given up due to demands for higher  wages by the labour citing unhealthy living conditions.The proposal was  resubmitted a number of times and in 1862, Captain J. G. Ryves, M.E., carried  out a study and submitted proposals in 1867 for another earthwork dam, 62 feet  high. The matter was debated by the Madras Government and the matter further  delayed by the terrible famine of 1876-77. Finally, in 1882, the construction  of the dam was approved and Major John Pennycuick, M.E., placed in charge to  prepare a revised project and estimate which was approved in 1884 by his superiors.</p>

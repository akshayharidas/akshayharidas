              <p align="justify" class="aa">The control and safety of the dam  and the validity and fairness of the lease agreement have been points of  dispute between Kerala and Tamil Nadu states. Supreme court judgment came in 27  February 2006, allowing Tamil Nadu to raise the level of the dam to 152 ft (46  m) after strengthening it. Responding to it, Mullaperiyar dam was declared an  'endangered' scheduled dam by the Kerala Government under the disputed Kerala  Irrigation and Water Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2006.<br />
                For Tamil Nadu, the Mullaperiyar  dam and the diverted Periyar waters act as a lifeline for Theni, Madurai,  Sivaganga and Ramnad districts, providing water for irrigation and drinking,  and also for generation of power in Lower Periyar Power Station. Tamil Nadu has  insisted on exercising its unfettered rights to control the dam and its waters,  based on the 1886 lease agreement. Kerala has pointed out the unfairness in the  1886 lease agreement and has challenged its validity. However, safety concerns  posed by the 119-year-old dam to the safety of the people of Kerala in the  event of a dam collapse, have been the focus of disputes from 2009 onwards.  Kerala's proposal for decommissioning the dam and constructing a new one has  been challenged by Tamil Nadu.<br />
                Tamil Nadu has insisted on  raising the water level in the dam to 142 feet, pointing out crop failures. One  estimate states that &quot;the crop losses to Tamil Nadu, because of the  reduction in the height of the dam, between 1980 and 2005 is a whopping ₹  40,000 crores. In the process the farmers of the erstwhile rain shadow areas in  Tamil Nadu who had started a thrice yearly cropping pattern had to go back to  the bi-annual cropping.&quot;<br />
                The Kerala Government maintains  that this is not true. During the year 1979–80 the gross area cultivated in  Periyar command area was 171,307 acres (693.25 km2). After the lowering of the  level to 136 ft (41 m), the gross irrigated area increased and in 1994–95 it  reached 229,718 acres (929.64 km2).The Tamil Nadu government had increased its  withdrawal from the reservoir, with additional facilities to cater to the  increased demand from newly irrigated areas.<br />
                In 2006, the Supreme Court of  India by its decision by a three-member division bench, allowed for the storage  level to be raised to 142 feet (43 m) pending completion of the proposed  strengthening measures, provision of other additional vents and implementation  of other suggestions.<br />
                However, the Kerala Government  promulgated a new &quot;Dam Safety Act&quot; against increasing the storage  level of the dam, which has been challenged by Tamil Nadu on various grounds.  The Supreme Court issued notice to Kerala to respond, however did not stay the  operation of the Act even as an interim measure. The Court then advised the  States to settle the matter amicably, and adjourned hearing in order to enable  them to do so. The Supreme Court of India termed the act as not  unconstitutional. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court constituted a Constitution bench  to hear the case considering its wide ramifications.<br />
                The Kerala Government states that  it does not object to giving water to Tamil Nadu, their main cause of objection  being the dam's safety as it is 116 years old. Increasing the level would add  more pressure to be handled by already leaking dam. Tamil Nadu wants the 2006 order  of Supreme court be implemented so as to increase the water level to 142 feet  (43 m).<br />
                In a 2000 Frontline edition, one  author stated thus:<br />
  &quot;For every argument raised  by Tamil Nadu in support of its claims, there is counter-argument in Kerala  that appears equally plausible. Yet, each time the controversy gets embroiled  in extraneous issues, two things stand out: One is Kerala's refusal to  acknowledge the genuine need of the farmers in the otherwise drought-prone  regions of Tamil Nadu for the waters of the Mullaperiyar; the other is Tamil  Nadu's refusal to see that it cannot rely on or continue to expect more and  more from the resources of another State to satisfy its own requirements to the  detriment of the other State. A solution perhaps lies in acknowledging the two  truths, but neither government can afford the political repercussions of such a  confession&quot;.<br />
                Tamil Nadu argues that the latter  is similar to tax revenues unfairly distributed to underdeveloped states within  India, to the detriment of the revenue producing states, i.e., a form of wealth  distribution. What we see here is a microcosm of the bigger problem that India  faces with China, which is building dams on Brahmaputra. In May 2014, Supreme  Court of India declared Kerala Irrigation and Water Conservation (Amendment)  Act, 2006 as unconstitutional. The Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down the  law passed by the Kerala Assembly on the Mullaperiyar Dam that said that the  water level cannot be increased beyond 135 feet. The court has ruled that Tamil  Nadu can increase the water level to 142 feet.<br />
                The court has said that there is  no threat to the safety of the dam. The apex court has set up a three-member  committee to look into the restoration work at the dam and also advise safety  and security measures.<br />
                The Kerala government's Dam  safety Act of 2006 has been scrapped by the court. In Feb 20, 2015 Kerala  Government Withdraws a plea seeking clarification on May 5, 2014 Judgement  which the apex court had allowed the raising the water storage level of the dam  to 142 feet and go before the three-member Mullaperiyar committee. The apex  court had also rejected the plea for giving open court hearing and said there  was no reason to interfere with the judgement of its five-judge Constitution  Bench. In an application, the Tamil Nadu government said Kerala has defied the  Supreme Court’s judgments in &quot;letter and spirit&quot;.Without mincing  words, it accused the Kerala government of harassment by denying Tamil Nadu  officials free entry to carry out routine periodical maintenance and repairs of  the dam.The application wants the Supreme Court to direct Kerala government to  allow free access to Tamil Nadu officials to the dam and its appurtenant  structures to collect data and change the weekly chart in the Mullakodi rainfall  station.It said the court should direct Kerala to allow Tamil Nadu to transport  the machinery and materials required for carrying out repairs.</p>

              <p align="justify" class="aa">Mullaiperiyar Dam is a masonry gravity dam on the Periyar  River in the   Indian state of Kerala. It is located 881 m (2,890 ft)  above mean sea   level, on the Cardamom Hills of the Western Ghats in Thekkady,  Idukki   District of Kerala, South India. It was constructed between 1887 and    1895 by John Pennycuick to divert water eastwards to the Madras   Presidency area  (present-day Tamil Nadu). It has a height of 53.6 m   (176 ft) from the  foundation, and a length of 365.7 m (1,200 ft). The   Periyar National  Park in Thekkady is located around the dam's   reservoir. The dam is located in  Kerala on the river Periyar, but is   operated and maintained by Tamil Nadu  state. Although the Periyar River   has a total catchment area of 5398 km2  with 114 km2 in Tamil Nadu, the   catchment area of the Mullaperiyar Dam  itself lies entirely in Kerala.   By reports on 21 November 2014, Mullaperiyar  water level touches 142   feet for first time in 35 years.</p>
